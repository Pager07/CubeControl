Goals:
1. Contorl a virtul cube with my hand
2. I should be able to do the following transformation:
	- Rotate the cube 
	- Enlarge the cube
	- Translate the cube 

Steps:
 1. Render the cube 
 	1a. learn to render basic cube
 	1b. learn to add transforamtion to the cube
 		- trasnlation
 		- rotation
 		- enlargement
 2. Obtain finger points model
 3. Map the finger points to the cube transformation 

 #Questions
  - What is a VertexShader?
  	- It's a programmable shader
  	- Handles the processing of individual vertices 
  	- Vertex shaders are fed Vertex Attribute data, as specified from a vertex array object by a drawing command. 
  	- A vertex shader receives a single vertex from the vertex stream and generates a single vertex to the output vertex stream

  	
  - What is a Fragment Shader?
  - What are the different Buffers that are needed?  	
    - vertexBuffer
  	- arrayBuffer
  	- axesVertexBuffer
 
  - What are the different matrix needed?
  	- modelMatrix
  	- viewMatrix
  	- projmatrix
  	- g_normalMatrix
